# Hi, 👋 I'm George Ward  
**Full Stack Software Engineer** | **IFBB Pro Bodybuilder** | **Builder of Systems That Scale**

I'm a full stack developer with 5+ years of experience building robust, scalable applications across frontend and backend. I specialize in Python, Flask, TypeScript, Angular, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Redis, with growing expertise in AI and cloud infrastructure (Azure, GCP). I’ve led engineering teams, worked in secure government environments, and delivered high-performance solutions in high-stakes settings.

As a software engineer and competitive bodybuilder, I bring discipline, structure, and a relentless drive for optimization to every project. I’m passionate about performance—whether it’s pushing code to run faster or training systems (and people) to be more efficient and resilient.

Currently, I’m exploring how LLMs and open-source AI models can power the next wave of developer tools. I’m also building a personal project that combines learning, tooling, and automation to showcase the full SDLC.

### What I bring to the table:
- ✔ Deep full-stack expertise across frontend, backend, and infrastructure  
- ✔ Leadership experience guiding teams and delivering under pressure  
- ✔ A growth mindset rooted in continuous learning, experimentation, and improvement  
- ✔ A passion for building tools that enable others to perform at their best
